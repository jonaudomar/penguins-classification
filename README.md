# penguins-classification

This project is exploring a dataset of penguins (penguins_classification.csv) that contains 3 columns :

- Culmen Length (mm) (see illustration below)
- Culmen Depth (mm)
- Species (Adelie, Gentoo or Chinstrap)

Here are 2 Jupyter notebooks :

- Part 1 where we are going to explore a classification task by a linear regression
- Part 2 where the classification task is done with a decision tree.

Theses exercices are extracted from the online course [Machine learning in Python with scikit-learn](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/) from Inria.

Let's explore the notebooks.
